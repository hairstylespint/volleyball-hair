<h2>1. High Ponytail with Braided Accents</h2>
<p>One of the most popular hairstyles among volleyball players is the high ponytail. In 2025, the trend has evolved with braided accents, adding both style and security. A small French or Dutch braid along the hairline keeps stray hairs in check while enhancing the overall look.</p>

<h2>4. Double Dutch Braids</h2>
<p>Double Dutch braids are a classic volleyball hairstyle that remains a favorite in 2025. They provide a tight and long-lasting hold, making them perfect for intense matches. Players also love them because they prevent sweat from interfering with vision.</p>
